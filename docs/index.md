## ***Knowledge Document Assignment 6***

# ***Introduction***

This assignment for introduction to python was to create a menu with options that will create and save data, but this time we had to use Classes and Functions.

# ***Code Explanation***

There are two basic Classes called IO and Processer which do essentially the same thing as the code in Assignment 5 but this time we call functions in the Classes so we do not have to copy and paste code. The only real problem I ran into was that I would forget to call the Class so I would copy and paste the function name but forget the class name.

# ***Execution***


# ***Summary***

This code creates a menu with options that performs different functions based on user input. This is different from Assignment 4 and 5 because we are now using Classes and functions.
